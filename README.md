This project is a social media platformm i built. Its coded using Typescript and the React library. 

The goal i achived is completing the FRONT END of the site using javascript to build the structure and SCSS to stlye the structure and design. The structure of the front end is an aestehtic web page that routes to different pages of the platform to support creating an account, logging in, logging out, a profile page, and a a home page that includes creating posts, liking posts, following and unfollwoing users.

The goal i achieved in completing the BACK END of the site is creating an API and REACT Query to be able to retrieve and store data from my client side(FRONT END) to my MySQL database. This includes using MySQL Workbench to manage and organize the data based on attributes such as post id, user id, comment id, etc to be able to keep a live feed of data on the site without needing to refresh the page. This also gave functionatlity to the front end functions such as liking posts, creating posts, adding comments to a post, and updating user profile info.
